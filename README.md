# Awesome FULL STACK WHATSUP messaging app clone. Looks even better than original one ))

# Using React as a front end
# Mongo DB + pusher on the backend

# [https://whatsup-clone-9dbbb.web.app/](https://whatsup-clone-9dbbb.web.app/)

# Main focus here is on UI design rather than on DB functionality although the server does support 2 API calls: to push a message and to pull messages from db. 
# While to achieve real time update from the DB i'm using pusher
